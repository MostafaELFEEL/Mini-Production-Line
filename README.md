# Mini-Production-Line: An Automated Assembly System

## Overview

The Mini-Production-Line is a fully automated assembly system designed for seamless product creation, consisting of five distinct stations: Feeding, Assembly, Sorting, Disassembly, and Handling. This state-of-the-art system minimizes human intervention, offering efficiency and precision in product assembly.

## System Workflow

### Feeding Station
The production cycle begins at the Feeding Station, where components are supplied to kick-start the assembly process.

### Assembly Station
Following feeding, the Assembly Station takes over, meticulously piecing together the supplied components to form a unified product.

### Sorting Station
Once assembled, the product is transferred to the Sorting Station. Here, its destination is determined based on weight specifications, and the product is temporarily stored for 30 seconds.

### Disassembly Station
After sorting, the product moves to the Disassembly Station. This station disassembles the product into its core components, readying it for the next production cycle.

### Handling Station
The product components are then looped back to the Feeding Station, completing the cycle for a new assembly sequence.
