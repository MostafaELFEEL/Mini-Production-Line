# Mini-Production-Line
## A Mini-production line consisting of five sub-stations (Feeding, Assembly, Sorting, Disassembly, and Handling).

In this project we are focusing on doing a fully automated production line for products that the user choose. The production line is divided into 5 main stations, Feeding, assembly, sorting, disassembly, and handling. Every station is fully automated, no need for any human interaction in the production line unless the user want to turn on/off the system or specific station.
The integration of the project has been done as CAD model by taking the 5 stations, and 
arrange them in the desired way as the feeding will start and feed the parts to the 
assembly station, which works to install the product as one part, then it goes to the sorting 
station which determine where to put the product depending on its weight and store it 
for 30 sec. After that, the part goes to the last station, which is the disassembly, it mainly 
disassemble the product to its main parts and finally deliver it to the feeding mechanism.
After the CAD, we had to make the simulation of the integrated project, this was done 
using MATLAB and the contact library which was the heart of the simulation. finally, we 
have implemented the project on real life with all necessary tools (electronics, drivers, 
valves...etc.)
